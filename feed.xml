This blog will serve as a bi-weekly tracker for my learning and practical application in the emerging domain of <strong>AI Security Engineering</strong>. Given my foundational expertise in both AI and traditional Security, my focus here is on understanding where the practical industry implementation and threat modeling are heading.</p>

<h2 id="ai-security-engineer-vs-traditional-security-engineer">AI Security Engineer vs. Traditional Security Engineer</h2>

<p>The role of a <strong>Traditional Security Engineer</strong> is fundamentally about securing the environment around the application: the network, the operating system, the data layer, and the established code base (e.g., against OWASP Top 10). The threat landscape, while evolving, is relatively well-defined.</p>

<p>The <strong>AI Security Engineer</strong> takes a distinct step forward, focusing on securing the <strong>Machine Learning (ML) lifecycle itself</strong>â€”the data, the model, and the deployment pipeline (MLOps). While traditional security protects the infrastructure <em>hosting</em> the model, AI Security protects the modelâ€™s <strong>integrity, confidentiality, and availability</strong> from <em>model-specific attacks</em>.</p>

<p>The discipline requires layering new ML-centric defenses over a robust foundation of cloud and application security.</p>

<h2 id="resource-plan--progress-tracker">Resource Plan &amp; Progress Tracker</h2>

<p>My goal is to dedicate a focused effort to bridge the theoretical knowledge gap with industry practices, especially since most deployments will be cloud-native.</p>

<h3 id="-core-reading">ðŸ“š Core Reading</h3>

<p>I will be extracting practical insights from the following texts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Developerâ€™s Playbook for Large Language Model Security</li>
  <li>Adversarial AI Attacks, Mitigations, and Defense Strategies</li>
  <li>Practicing Trustworthy Machine Learning</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-courses--certifications">ðŸŽ“ Courses &amp; Certifications</h3>

<p>I plan to examine the curriculum and key takeaways from these industry-recognized programs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Certified AI Security Professional - AI Security Certification - Practical DevSecOps
* AI security fundamentals - Training | Microsoft Learn</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-daily-focus-the-mlops-foundation">ðŸŽ¥ Daily Focus: The MLOps Foundation</h3>

<p>To ensure I understand the operational context of AI deployment, I am dedicating <strong>2 hours a day</strong> to mastering the production lifecycle. My starting point is a deep dive into AWS deployment:</p>

<p>Looking forward to posting my first progress update / or lab deployment in two weeks!</p>]]></content><author><name>Banny Orojo</name></author><category term="ai-security" /><category term="devsecops" /><category term="llm-security" /><category term="mlops" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a PhD student with a deep background in both AI and traditional security, Iâ€™m pivoting my focus to the practical, industry-driven field of AI Security Engineering.
